Pizza Compass Knock-off in HTML5

I created this to deonstrate the HTML5 Device APIs.

W3C APIs:

- Geolocation API to get the current location
- DeviceOrientation event to dislay the compass using device's magnetometer

The 3rd Party APIs:

- Foursquare APIs to locate nearby businesses
- Google Maps for displaying map
