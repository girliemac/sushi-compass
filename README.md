Sushi Compass
=============

Pizza Compass Knock-off in HTML5!

I created this simple web app to deonstrate the HTML5 Device APIs.

W3C APIs:
- Geolocation API to get the current location
- DeviceOrientation event to dislay the compass using device's magnetometer

The 3rd Party APIs:
- Foursquare APIs to locate nearby businesses
- Google Maps for displaying map
